ti92plus
========

Fixes the mixed up unicode encoding of the extended character sets provided by Ti92Pluspc.ttf.

Ti92Pluspc is very similar to Menlo.

####Disclaimer:####

To my knowledge Ti92Pluspc.ttf is shareware.

If that is not correct I don't pretend to own any existing copyright for the font itself, however it is a pretty decent fixed-width programming font and it's a damn shame that no version with correct unicode support exists.
